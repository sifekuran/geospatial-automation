# geospatial-automation
Developed a Python script using arcpy to iterate through multiple feature classes and clip corresponding raster datasets. Implemented error-handling, batch-export automation, and output-path validation to ensure clean raster production.  Streamlined large-scale raster processing, improving workflow efficiency for multi-scene geospatial analyses.
